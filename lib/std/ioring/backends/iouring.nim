# Linux io_uring backend.
# Uses the existing Queue from lib/std/posix/io_uring.nim.
# Does not use PollBackend since io_uring uses its own submission/completion
# queue model.
#
# Submissions are deferred to a shared queue so that the calling thread
# (e.g. main) never owns an SQE — every SQE is filled and flushed on the
# thread that calls poll(), which is always a worker thread (or whomever
# calls waitCompletions()). That avoids the "submitted on main, never
# polled" hang.

  ## `newQueue(sqEntries)` — `defaultFlags`, i.e. `{}` — so the backend had
  ## completion semantics instead of readiness semantics and none of the
  ## behaviour that makes completions worth having.
  ##
  ## `SINGLE_ISSUER` declares what this backend already guarantees: a lane's ring
  ## is submitted by exactly one thread. `COOP_TASKRUN` drops the per-completion
  ## IPI, letting completion work run at the next ring transition instead. Both
  ## are measured neutral on the loopback WebSocket matrix (27.9 MB/s, p95 159
  ## against a no-flags control of 27.9 / 160) — enabled because they are
  ## honest descriptions of this backend, not because loopback showed a win.
  ##
  ## `SINGLE_ISSUER` binds the ring to its submitter **when the ring is
  ## CREATED**, which is why `adoptLane` exists.
  ##
  ## **`DEFER_TASKRUN` is not here yet, and not for lack of trying.** It is the
  ## flag that should matter most — completion work would run when the owning
  ## task next calls `io_uring_enter` rather than being pushed to it through
  ## task_work — and `SINGLE_ISSUER` is its prerequisite, so it is now within
  ## reach for the first time. Enabling it measures **0.8 MB/s against 27.9**,
  ## with 94% of reader polls finding an empty socket: completions are barely
  ## being reaped. Hoisting the `submit` out of the `n > 0` branch so that a poll
  ## with nothing to submit still enters — the obvious first suspect, since
  ## deferred work needs an enter to run — **does not fix it**, so something
  ## further in the poll loop's contract with deferred completions is wrong and
  ## is not yet diagnosed. Do not enable it without re-running the matrix.
  ##
  ## NOT `SQPOLL`: one kernel polling thread **per ring**, and we create
  ## `ioLanes()` rings — `workerCount + 1` kernel threads spinning, which on a
  ## core-bound host costs more than it saves.
  ##
  ## `-d:nimIoringPlainSetup` restores the old empty set, so a regression can be
  ## bisected to this decision rather than to the backend as a whole.

  ## `io_uring_setup` runs, not when the ring is first used. Rings are created in
  ## `tryInitLocalQueues` on whichever thread called `initLoop()`, while a worker
  ## lane is submitted only ever by its own worker, so a ring created there and
  ## submitted here is refused. Creating it here instead is the whole fix:
  ## measured with `SINGLE_ISSUER`, a 4-connection cell went from **0.0 MB/s with
  ## 100% of reader polls finding an empty socket** to 27.9 MB/s at p95 159 —
  ## indistinguishable from the no-flags control.
  ##
  ## **Why replace rather than create lazily into an empty slot.** A `Queue` owns
  ## a fd and three mappings and has no valid zero state — `newSeq[Queue]` cannot
  ## build one — so `seq[Queue]` cannot carry a hole. Assigning over the slot
  ## destroys the plain ring and installs the owned one, which costs one unused
  ## ring per worker at startup and keeps the type honest everywhere else.
  ##
  ## The trailing lane is deliberately skipped: `ioLane()` hands it to every
  ## non-worker submitter, so no single thread can claim it and `SINGLE_ISSUER`
  ## there would be a promise we cannot keep.
  ##
  ## A refusal (kernel too old — `SINGLE_ISSUER` needs 6.0, `DEFER_TASKRUN` 6.1,
  ## `COOP_TASKRUN` 5.19, and `io_uring_setup` answers `-EINVAL` rather than
  ## ignoring an unknown flag) simply leaves the plain ring in place.
