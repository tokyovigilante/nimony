## Hastur - Tester tool for Nimony and its related subsystems (Leng etc).
## (c) 2024-2025 Andreas Rumpf
##
## This module is the COMMAND LINE — the usage text, the option parsing and the
## dispatch. Everything it dispatches to lives in a sibling module here in
## `src/hastur/`, and `kit.nim` re-exports that surface for a test directory's
## `setup.nim` custom runner.

Usage:
  hastur [options] [command] [arguments]

Commands:
  build [all|nimony|nifler|hexer|lengc|shoggoth|nifmake|validator|dagon|pnak|arkham|nifasm|jorogumo|native|nifbench]   build selected tools (default: all).
                       `nifbench` is the NIF micro-benchmark suite (bench/),
                       built with host Nim so it can be compared against the same
                       source built by `nimony c` and `nimony n`.
                       `all` builds arkham + nifasm too when the sibling
                       `../nativenif` is checked out, and says so when it is not;
                       `native` (arkham + nifasm + shoggoth) asks for them by
                       name and errors out instead.
  tiers [native]       compile every module on the bootstrap list with nimony.
                       `native` uses `nimony n` (arkham + nifasm) instead of
                       `nimony c`: the list is a walk of the bootstrap DAG from
                       the leaves up, so it attributes each native gap to the
                       smallest module that reaches it — which `boot` cannot do,
                       since it compiles three whole tools and reports only the
                       first that died. Nothing fails fast: the run ends with one
                       line per distinct diagnostic and the modules reaching it.
                       `--forward:` is appended to every compile (e.g.
                       `--forward:-d:release`).
  boot [options]       Self-host the *full* nimony toolchain (nimony,
                       nimsem, hexer). `bin0/` is a fresh copy of the
                       host-Nim-built toolchain; `binN/` is `binN-1/`'s
                       nimony recompiling all three from source. Runs a
                       fixed number of self-compile passes and leaves the
                       results in place — nothing is installed back to
                       `bin/`. Extra args are forwarded to every
                       `nimony c` invocation.
                       Every stage is compiled with `-d:release` by default
                       (the wider test: shoggoth + the `when defined(release)`
                       paths). `--no-release` boots at the default opt level.
                       To boot at another mode use `--forward:` so the flag
                       survives getopt intact — `--forward:-d:danger` replaces
                       the default rather than stacking on it.
                       On linux/amd64 every stage is built with the C-FREE
                       NATIVE backend (`nimony n`: arkham + nifasm, no C
                       compiler, no libc) when those two are built; otherwise
                       through the C backend.
  selfcheck            full compiler regression check: rebuilds the nimony
                       toolchain (nimony+nimsem+hexer share `programs.nim`),
                       runs `tiers`, then `boot --valgrind` (release). Use this
                       after touching any module the compiler itself imports.
  <dir>                run the test tree rooted at <dir> (see Files below):
                       each directory is either a setup.nim custom runner or
                       the built-in nimony runner, recursively. This is the
                       general entry point — point it at any suite.
  all                  run the whole suite: `<tests>` + `<examples>`.
  nativevalgrind       run the native regression set with `-d:valgrind`, under
                       memcheck, and demand that memcheck reports nothing. This
                       is what says the allocator's heap instrumentation
                       (`lib/std/system/valgrind.nim`) describes the heap
                       truthfully rather than plausibly. Linux/AArch64 for now,
                       which is where `VgClientRequest` has a lowering.
  native               run the curated native-backend regression set through
                       `nimony n` (arkham + nifasm, from the sibling
                       `../nativenif` checkout). See `NativeTestDirs`/`Files`.
  wasmdiff             differential harness: run every `tests/ithaqua/*.nim`
                       through BOTH the native backend (arkham, the oracle)
                       and the wasm backend (ithaqua) and require matching
                       stdout + exit code. Needs the sibling `../nativenif`
                       and `node` on PATH.
  lengc                 run Leng tests.
  test <file>/<dir>    run a single test <file>, or a flat <dir> of tests.
  joined <dir>         run <dir>'s joinable tests as ONE program (see
                       `--joined` below). This is what the test pool spawns
                       per directory; by hand it is how you run or debug a
                       single group.
  bug [file]           build nimony+hexer and compile <file> to fill nimcache/.
                       If no file is provided `bug.nim` is used.
  rep                  repeat the last failing tool command from the session.
  record <file> <tout> track the results to make it part of the test suite.
  update deps          re-pin `src/nativenif.commit` — the sibling nativenif
                       commit arkham and nifasm are built from — to whatever
                       `../nativenif` currently has checked out. Every other
                       command PUTS nativenif on that commit before building
                       it (a dirty nativenif tree is left alone, with a
                       warning). The file is read at run time; an empty or
                       absent one means "build whatever is checked out".
  update parser        re-pin `src/nifler/nimparser/upstream.commit` — Nim's
                       own `compiler/parser.nim`, which nifler parses `.nim`
                       source with — to the tip of nim-lang/Nim `devel`, and
                       check it out. `build nifler` checks out the pin (from a
                       Nim git checkout on this machine if it has the commit,
                       else one HTTPS fetch); an empty or absent pin means
                       "use whatever parser the host compiler ships".
  install              write activation script(s) at the project root that
                       prepend the toolchain dirs to `$PATH` for the current
                       shell. On Windows, also download MinGW+LLVM (gcc,
                       clang, lld) and Nim's DLL deps into `external/`.
  clean                remove all generated files.
  sync [new-branch]    delete current branch and pull the latest
                       changes from remote. Optionally creates a new branch.

Arguments are forwarded to the Nimony compiler.

Options:
  --overwrite           overwrite the selected test results. Implies
                        `--joined:off`: a golden is regenerated from the test
                        running on its own. A plain test that prints without
                        an `.output` file gets one written here — that is what
                        makes it joinable.
  --ast                 track the contents of the AST too
  --codegen             track the contents of the code generator too
  --version             show the version
  --help                show this help
  --forward:OPTION      pass an option to the Nimony compiler
  --debug               build the front-end tools (nimony, nimsem, hexer, …)
                        unoptimized; they default to -d:release, like arkham
                        and nifasm. For gdb work on the tools themselves —
                        a debug toolchain is ~8x slower at compiling, so all
                        test runs want the default
  --release             no-op for the toolchain (release is the default); for
                        `boot` it additionally compiles the bootstrapped
                        nimony's own output with --opt:speed
  --jobs:N|auto         run up to N tests in parallel (auto = #cores)
  --joined:on|off       compile a directory's plain tests into ONE program
                        (default on) instead of one per test. Most of a test's
                        cost is the process tree behind it — nifler, nimsem,
                        hexer, lengc, nifmake, the C compiler, the linker —
                        so this is the big lever on Windows. A group that
                        fails is re-run test by test, so failures stay
                        attributable; `off` skips the grouping altogether.
  --native:on|off       on WINDOWS, compile the tests `hastur native` vouches
                        for with `nimony n` rather than `nimony c` (default
                        on). Same assertion, no gcc and no linker behind it —
                        the other half of the lever `--joined` pulls. Ignored
                        on every other host.
  --cachedir:PATH       use PATH instead of `nimcache/` for intermediates
  --bindir:PATH         resolve the toolchain (nimony, lengc, …) from
                        directory PATH instead of hastur's own directory
                        (implies --no-build). Binaries not found there are
                        looked up on `$PATH`.
  --no-build            skip the setup.hastur prep step during the tree walk
  --skip:DIR            leave DIR out of the tree walk (repeatable). For
                        splitting one sweep across CI runners: the tester job
                        passes `--skip:tests/boot` while a second job runs
                        `hastur tests/boot`. Unlike `hastur.mode = skip` this
                        does not change what a plain local run covers.
  --native-debug        build arkham + nifasm unoptimized (they default to
                        -d:release); for `-d:arkhamDbgSym` / gdb toolchain work
  --boot-backend:auto|c|native
                        which backend `boot` compiles the stages with. `auto`
                        (default) is per-host: `nimony n` where the native
                        backend is complete and arkham/nifasm are in bin/,
                        `nimony c` otherwise. The other two force it, which is
                        how the two are timed against each other.
  --valgrind            for `boot`: build with -DMI_TRACK_VALGRIND=1 so
                        mimalloc plays nicely with valgrind, then run a
                        valgrind smoke test on the bootstrapped binary.
                        Forces the C backend (valgrind cannot see the native
                        backend's libc-free heap).

Files (per test directory, all optional):
  setup.nim             a custom runner program that owns this directory and
                        its subtree: hastur compiles+runs it (it imports
                        `src/hastur/kit` as the test kit) and takes its exit
                        code as the verdict. For suites that aren't a folder
                        of inputs (boot, incremental, validator) or need a
                        bespoke tool (dagon, pnak, hexer, controlflow,
                        contracts).
  setup.hastur          prep for a built-in-runner directory: each line is a
                        hastur subcommand (e.g. `build nimony`) run before the
                        tests beneath it. `tests/setup.hastur` builds the
                        toolchain for the whole sweep.
  <test>.nojoin         keep <test> out of its directory's joined program (see
                        `--joined`). For a test whose output is not
                        reproducible in a shared process, or that races with
                        its neighbours over a shared build artifact.
  hastur.mode           this directory's category for the built-in nimony
                        runner: nosystem, track, compat, valgrind, opt, or
                        skip (excluded from the sweep, but still run when
                        pointed at directly). Absent means normal.
